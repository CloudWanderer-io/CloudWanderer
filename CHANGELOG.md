# 0.4.0

- Introduced more structured `CloudWandererResource` result object to ensure resource attribute keys don't clash with resource keys.
- Refactored `CloudWanderer` main class and abstracted much of it into `CloudWandererInterface`
- Added boto3 `Sesssion` support to allow passing of non-default credentials and configuration options.
